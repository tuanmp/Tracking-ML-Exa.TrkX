However, it is generally directed towards the Exatrkx pipeline for track reconstruction, which handles HEP data as graph-structured . This means that many of the models are related to either: Constructing graphs (e.g. metric learning, filtering) Learning node or edge feature representations (e.g. edge classification) Segmenting and processing graphs (e.g. segment stitching, splitting) If you have, for example, image-structured data, the pipeline management tool TrainTrack will still be useful, but many of these models will not. On the other hand, you might consider if your images are representations of some sparse underlying physics whether they could be better-represented as graphs... Including a New Model As such, new models are welcome to be included. Currently, new models can either be added to the general model collection in Architectures or, if the model is intended to be used in an example application, in that application's pipeline in Pipelines/APPLICATION/LightningModules/ . Models are organised by their architecture, which allows much of the common code to be abstracted out. For example, a particular convolution of a GNN can be specified in GNN/Models/my_new_gnn.py which inherits all the training behavior of GNNBase in GNN/gnn_base.py . The models are written in Pytorch Lightning , to avoid as much training boilerplate as possible. To include a new model, or a new base class that doesn't yet exist, it should be implemented in Pytorch Lightning. It usually takes 5-10 minutes to convert vanilla Pytorch code to Pytorch Lightning , see for example this Lightning Tutorial. Once a model is included in a Pipeline, it can included as a stage, as in the TrackML Example . Available Models Pre-Processing In order to easily consume data for machine learning, it is beneficial to package it into a \"feature store\". This takes the large, possibly messy, possibly text/csv-format, possibly missing dataset and makes it uniform and as light as it can be. The feature store processor here uses the Pytorch Geometric (PyG) data class, for several reasons: a) It is compatible with the PyG dataloader class, which takes it as a simple list and we therefore seriously reduce boilerplate; b) It is a class than can be entirely placed on and off a device with a simple .to(device) ; and c) The PyG dataloader automatically batches graph-structured data in the correct way. The FeatureStore class is a LightningDataModule that is compatible with the TrainTrack system - that is, it doesn't do any training or inference, but is instead understood to be a processing stage. It does this by implementing a prepare_data method, and the rest is automatic.

The first is the simplest: pid_truth . If two spacepoints share a particle ID ( pid ), an edge between them is given pid_truth=1 . Otherwise pid_truth=0 . This also shows up in the library as y_pid , as a toggle that can be turned on/off in GNN training. This truth definition is useful when a graph has already been constructed , as in GNN training. The other definition of truth is modulewise_truth . This is based on the concept of a module-wise truth graph, which will be useful to visualize. Truth Graph A cartoon of a truth graph, with orange edges and X nodes. Each blue line is a module here (note the dashed layers of the barrel - the layers are made of many small modules) A truth graph is simply some target graph that tries to represent the underlying physics in some way. It must be opinionated, and there is clearly not a single, correct way to define it. That said, for the ITk geometry, we define it by: 1. Order all spacepoints of a track by increasing distance from its creation vertex 2. Connect each pair of spacepoints in this sequence, as an edge in a graph 3. (Module-wise definition) Where two spacepoints are on the same module , do not join them. Instead, form all pair combinations with the preceding and succeeding spacepoints. To phrase this module-wise defintion differently, for the set of spacepoints {x_i} and modules {m_i} in the diagram, we order all spacepoints as [(x_0, m_0), (x_1, m_1), (x_2, m_2), (x_3, m_3), ((x_4, x_5), m_4), (x_6, m_5)] Therefore our edge list becomes (x_0, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), (x_3, x_4), (x_3, x_5), (x_4, x_6), (x_5, x_6) This is achieved quite efficiently in code with: ``` py title=\"get_modulewise_edges()\" ... signal_list = ( signal.groupby( [\"particle_id\", \"barrel_endcap\", \"layer_disk\", \"eta_module\", \"phi_module\"], sort=False, )[\"hit_id\"] .agg(lambda x: list(x)) .groupby(level=0) .agg(lambda x: list(x)) ) true_edges = [] for row in signal_list.values: for i, j in zip(row[:-1], row[1:]): true_edges.extend(list(itertools.product(i, j))) ``` Modulewise and PID Truth Given these definitions of truth, we can visualize them both on an example graph constructed across two track: Two graphs with different ground truth definitions for the edges. Black edges are true positives, red a false positives, blue are false negatives Note that PID truth is fairly obvious: if an edge connects nodes of the same color (i.e. from the same particle) then it's a true positive, otherwise it's a false positive. In the construction of a graph with this definition of truth, there's no real concept of a \"missing true edge\" - or false negative - since a track of N spacepoints has N choose 2 (O(N^2)) \"true edges\", which is computationally expensive to handle (see Embedding training to understand why). This is why this definition is not used in graph construction. Once constructed, and each existing edge is being classified, it makes more sense to use this definition. The modulewise truth takes the graph on the left, but applies our truth graph to it. Thus, we see that edges that skip across the sequence are treated as false. We also see that we can efficiently define false positives, since each particle of N spacepoints will only have O(N) true edges. The trade-off for this more physically-motivated truth definition is that it's more expensive to calculate the accuracy and loss functions. Instead of simply checking the PID, we have to do a graph intersection , which provides a full list of true/fake positive/negative edges in the prediction graph.","title":"Truth Definitions"},{"location":"performance/truth_definitions/#truth-definitions","text":"","title":"Truth Definitions"},{"location":"performance/truth_definitions/#trackml-tracking","text":"","title":"TrackML Tracking"},{"location":"performance/truth_definitions/#edge-wise-truth","text":"In training the various stages of the pipeline, two definitions of pair-wise or edge-wise truth are used.

The Front Door Assuming you've installed the Exatrkx tracking library and tried the Quickstart, then welcome. The aim of this repository is to both be a place to demonstrate our published results and pipelines, and also to show new developments in our work. To that end, various projects (i.e. physics use-cases) are given as templates in the Pipelines directory. To see a frozen reproduction of the pipeline used in our paper , go to Pipelines/TrackML_Example . A relatively frozen example of tracking on the ATLAS ITk detector is given in Pipelines/ITk_Example . Development code is available in Pipelines/Common_Tracking_Example , which is named due to many of the functions working across both detectors. This page gives some outlines and justifications of the choice of the repository's organisation. The Models page defines the models used in track reconstruction. The Tools page describes the various stand-alone functions and concepts that are available in the library and could be useful across models. Performance is where metrics are defined, as well as tracking benchmarks. How do Pipelines work? The aim of our pipeline structure is to abstract out as much repetitive code as possible. A pipeline is defined by a YAML config file, which only requires three inputs: The location of your model definitions model_library , the location to save/load your artifacts artifact_library , and the stages of the pipeline stage_list . An example stage list is - {set: GNN, name: SliceCheckpointedResAGNN, config: train_gnn.yaml} The set key defines the type of ML model (to help avoid naming ambiguity), the name key is the class of the model, and the config key is the file specifying your choice of hyperparameters, directories, callbacks and so on. And that's it! The repository through an application lens, using Pipelines for specific physics goals Why this choice of abstraction? I found that my two forms of R&D fell into breadth and depth. Much of the time, I would play at length with hyperparameters and model definitions, in which case I want that all to live in one place: The model's config file. Thus the pipeline config can remain untouched if we have one for each choice of (model, config) , or only changed occasionally if we choose to have only one. At other times, development would require a series of models, where successive results depend on hyperparameter choices earlier in the chain. Then I can play with the higher level pipeline config and try difference (model, config) stages, while the whole chain of hyperparameters is committed to each step via a logging platform (Weights & Biases in my case). Pytorch Lightning This repository uses Pytorch Lightning, which allows us to encapsulate all training and model logic into a module object. This module is what is being specified by the pipeline config, with name . Combined with callbacks in the model config file, all pipeline logic is contained in each module. A callback object integrates with the module and knows about telemetry and post-processing steps.

Running the Pipeline Configuration A pipeline runs at three layers of configuration, to allow for as much flexibility as possible. To get running immediately however, you needn't change any of the defaults. From the Pipelines/TrackML_Example/ directory, we run traintrack configs/pipeline_quickstart.yaml While it's running, get a cup of tea and a Tim-Tam, and let's see what it's doing: Default behaviour Our quickstart pipeline is running three stages, with a single configuration for each. You can see in config/pipeline_quickstart.yaml that the three stages are: A Processing stage with the class FeatureStore and config prepare_small_feature_store.yaml ; An Embedding stage with the class LayerlessEmbedding and config train_small_embedding.yaml ; and A GNN stage with the class VanillaFilter and config train_small_filter.yaml . The Processing stage is exactly that: data processing. It is not \"trainable\", and so the pipeline treats it differently than a trainable stage. Under the hood, it is a LightningDataModule, rather than the trainable models, which inherit from LightningModule. In this case, FeatureStore is performing some calculations on the cell information in the detector, and constructing truth graphs that will later be used for training. These calculations are computationally expensive, so it doesn't make sense to calculate them on-the-fly while training. The trainable models Embedding and GNN are learning the non-linear metric of the truth graphs, and pairwise likelihoods of hits sharing a truth graph edge, respectively. The details are not so important at this stage, what matters is that these stages are modular: Each one can be run alone, but by adding a callback to the end, it can prepare the dataset for the next stage. Looking at LightningModules/Embedding/train_small_embedding.yaml you will see that a callback is given as callbacks: EmbeddingInferenceCallback . Any number of callbacks can be added, and they adhere to the Lightning callback system . The one referred to here runs the best version of the trained Embedding model on each directory of the data split (train, val, test) and saves it for the next stage. We could also add a telemetry callback, e.g. the EmbeddingTelemetry callback in LightningModules/Embedding/Models/inference.py . This callback prints a PDF of the transverse momentum vs. the efficiency of the metric learning model, saving it in the output_dir . It \"hooks\" into the testing phase, which is run after every training phase. The default settings of this run pull from the three configuration files given at each stage.

In this case, FeatureStore is performing some calculations on the cell information in the detector, and constructing truth graphs that will later be used for training. These calculations are computationally expensive, so it doesn't make sense to calculate them on-the-fly while training. The trainable models Embedding and GNN are learning the non-linear metric of the truth graphs, and pairwise likelihoods of hits sharing a truth graph edge, respectively. The details are not so important at this stage, what matters is that these stages are modular: Each one can be run alone, but by adding a callback to the end, it can prepare the dataset for the next stage. Looking at LightningModules/Embedding/train_small_embedding.yaml you will see that a callback is given as callbacks: EmbeddingInferenceCallback . Any number of callbacks can be added, and they adhere to the Lightning callback system . The one referred to here runs the best version of the trained Embedding model on each directory of the data split (train, val, test) and saves it for the next stage. We could also add a telemetry callback, e.g. the EmbeddingTelemetry callback in LightningModules/Embedding/Models/inference.py . This callback prints a PDF of the transverse momentum vs. the efficiency of the metric learning model, saving it in the output_dir . It \"hooks\" into the testing phase, which is run after every training phase. The default settings of this run pull from the three configuration files given at each stage. You can look at them","title":"Default behaviour"},{"location":"tools/data/","text":"Data & Graph Manipulation Data Processing Constructing Truth Graph The purpose of a \"truth graph\" is explained in Truth Definitions . Here we explain how it is constructed. Begin with a set of hit IDs (HIDs) with associated particle IDs (PIDs). For ITk, this set has duplicated HIDs . This is because two particles may leave a hit in a very coincident space on a module. In that case, we cannot be sure whether the hit is from a single particle, or from many - it is called \"merged\" in the latter case. We only know a hit is \"merged\" from ground truth. Therefore, there is not a unique map from HIDs to PIDs, and we may have many PIDs associated with a single HID. We preserve this many-many map in the input dataframe, in order to construct the truth graph. Calculate the distance of each hit from its creation vertex, and order the entire set by this distance. We now have sequential ordering. Group the entries of this set by PID and module ID. The module ID is whatever combination of identifiers gives a unique module. In the case of ITk, this is [barrel_endcap, layer_disk, eta_module, phi_module] . In the case of TrackML, this is [volume_id, layer_id, module_id] . For each particle, iterate through pairs in the list of hits. Since we group by modules, this list is of the form [[0], [1], [2, 3], [4], ...] , such that where there is more than one entry we take a product of the combinations. E.g. [1] x [2, 3] = [1, 2], [1, 3] . Concatenate all these pairs into an edge list for the full truth graph. Throw away duplicates of HIDs . This is a hack and liable to change. This makes referencing hits very simple, since now there is only one hit ID per node, and only one PID per hit. This contradicts our knowledge of merged hits, but since only ~0.2% of hits are merged, we accept this approximation for now. Graph Processing Graph Intersection Consider a \"prediction graph\" and a \"target graph\". How do we compare the two? The simplest way is to treat each edge as a prediction, and see which edges overlap (true positives) and which do not (false positives). This can be done very efficiently with sparse arrays. Convert predicted e_p and truth e_t edge lists into sparse arrays, with either scipy.sparse or cupy.sparse Define an intersection array by intersection = e_p.multiply(e_t) - ((e_p - e_t) > 0) This is simple boolean logic: The first value gives 1 for true positives, and 0 otherwise. The second value gives 1 for false positives, and 0 otherwise. Combining them gives us a sparse array of 1 (for true positives) and -1 (for false positives). Thus when we convert back to a (2, N) edge list, we take intersection > 0 to be a true edge, and intersection < 0 to be a fake edge.","title":"Data & Graph Manipulation"},{"location":"tools/data/#data-graph-manipulation","text":"","title":"Data &amp; Graph Manipulation"},{"location":"tools/data/#data-processing","text":"","title":"Data Processing"},{"location":"tools/data/#constructing-truth-graph","text":"The purpose of a \"truth graph\" is explained in Truth Definitions .
